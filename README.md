These giants of the forest are something to behold. Some have been \
growing for a thousand years, and each tree contains its own story \
of the centuries' long struggle for survival. Looking at the annular \
rings of the wood, you can tell what seasons they have been through. \
In some drought years they almost perished, as growth is barely perceptible. \
In others, the growth was far greater. - George Yeoman Pocock
